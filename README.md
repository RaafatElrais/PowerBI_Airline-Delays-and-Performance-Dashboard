# PowerBI_Airline-Delays-and-Performance-Dashboard
📘 Project Overview

This Power BI project analyzes airline performance and delay causes across multiple airports and carriers.
The goal was to uncover patterns in flight operations, identify performance bottlenecks, and suggest actionable strategies to reduce delays and cancellations.

⚠️ Business Challenge

Airlines face frequent operational disruptions due to weather, maintenance, and scheduling issues, leading to high delay percentages and poor customer experience.
The company lacked a clear, consolidated view of these factors to make data-driven improvements.

💡 Approach

Cleaned and prepared flight data using Power Query and SQL.

Designed a multi-page Power BI dashboard including:

Overview Page: Flight totals, cancellations, diversions, and monthly flight trends.

Delay’s Cause Page: Breakdown of delay reasons (carrier, weather, NASD, security).

Performance Page: Focused analysis for major carriers like Southwest Airlines, showing per-airport delays and flight performance.

Implemented Drill-through pages and interactive tooltips to let users navigate between carrier-level and airport-level insights seamlessly.

Used KPIs and charts (bar, line, and pie visuals) to make trends and patterns instantly readable.

🖼️ Dashboard Overview

Main Insights Across Pages:

Total Flights: 2M

Cancelled Flights: 635

Diverted: 7,790

Delayed Flights: 36K (≈1.8%)

Average Arrival Delay: 42 minutes

Top 5 Carriers: Southwest, United, SkyWest, US Airways, Pinnacle

Main Delay Reasons:

Carrier Delay – 34.2%

Weather Delay – 20.8%

Late Aircraft Delay – 19.6%

NASD Delay – 19.9%

Security Delay – 5.4%

💡 The dashboard uses clear navigation buttons and intuitive visuals, allowing users to switch between Overview, Delay Analysis, and Performance with one click.

📊 Key Insights

Southwest Airlines operates over 378K flights yearly but shows an average arrival delay of 30 minutes.

Weather and carrier-related issues contribute to more than 55% of total delays.

Delays peak during summer months (June–August) and drop towards the end of the year.

Chicago O’Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson are the busiest airports, accounting for a large share of delayed flights.

✅ Recommendations

Optimize scheduling and turnaround times for carriers with repeated late arrivals.

Enhance weather delay prediction systems to proactively reschedule or reroute flights.

Invest in ground operations to reduce carrier and NASD-related delays.

Monitor airport-specific delay patterns using the drill-through views for targeted performance improvements.
